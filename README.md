# Simple-Matchmaking-architecture-RMI
A simple matchmaking project for the advanced oop course.

Pretty much the same as this project https://github.com/sherbocopter/Simple-Matchmaking-architecture
The only difference is that it uses RMI.

**Note:** This one is, too, an educational project built in a weekend, nothing fancy.
